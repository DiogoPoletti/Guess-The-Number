# Guess The Number

## Description
A Python based program that prompts the user to guess the number randomly generated by the program using the *input* method. The program will then run the users answer through conditions in order to compare the answer with the real number. If the number is higher, the program will prompt the user again displaying a message asking for a lower number. The opposite will display a message asking for a highert number. If the user wants to exit, typing 0 will trigger another condition where the user will be prompeted to enter either *Y* or *N* to exit or not.

> The number generated was displayed in the IDLE for demonstration purposes.

## What have I learnt
Creating this program enabled me to practice a few aspects:
* Improve with Python syntax and good practises when coding.
* Use *random* library and learn a few functions.

## Code highlight
The following block of code is the entire program where loopings and conditions where triggered.

```
//Checks each input from the user
while guess != randomNumber:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10000: "))
    
    if guess == 0:
        exit = input("Are you sure you want to leave? (Y/N)").upper()
        if exit == 'Y':
            print("Thanks for playing!!")
            break
        else:
             continue
    
    elif guess == randomNumber:
        print("That's the correct number.")

    elif guess > randomNumber:
        print("Wrong number, aim lower.")
        continue

    elif guess < randomNumber:
        print("Wrong number, aim higher.")
        continue

    else:
        print("Enter a number please!")
        continue
```
