# Guess The Number

## Description
A Python based program that prompts the user to guess the number randomly generated by the program using the *input* method. The program will then run the users answer through conditions in order to compare the answer with the real number. If the number is higher, the program will prompt the user again displaying a message asking for a lower number. The opposite will display a message asking for a highert number. If the user wants to exit, typing 0 will trigger another condition where the user will be prompeted to enter either *Y* or *N* to exit or not.

## What have I learnt
Creating this game enabled me to practice a few aspects:
* Get familiar with DOM methods and funcitons.
* Engage multiple laguages in a project.
* Get familiar with conditions and loops.
* Use BootStrap 3/4 in a simple web browser game.

## Code highlight
The number generated was displayed in the idle for demonstration purposes.

```
//Create a function that will check the square maker
function maker() {
    if(this.textContent === ''){
        this.textContent = 'X';
    } else if(this.textContent === 'X') {
            this.textContent = 'O';
    } else {
        this.textContent = '';
    }
}
```
